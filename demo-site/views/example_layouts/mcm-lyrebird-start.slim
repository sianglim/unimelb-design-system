        h2.title ANZAC
        p This work for orchestra and nine soloists is a personal reflection on the ANZAC phenomenon. The nine soloists, supported by the orchestra, may be seen as suggesting characters, moods, images, or memories, in dream-like references to confusion, nostalgia, ceremony and contradiction. 
        p The work is in two parts, each having a number of continuous sections. Here they are, with (in brackets) the soloists featured.
